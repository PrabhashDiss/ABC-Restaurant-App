# Hotel Booking App 

## Introduction
This repository contains the source code for a Hotel Booking App built using Java, Spring Boot, React, MySQL, and JWT authentication. The application allows users to search for hotels, view details, make bookings, and manage their reservations.

## Technologies

- **Java**: Java is a widely-used programming language known for its portability and versatility. In this project, Java is used for backend development.
  
- **Spring Boot**: Spring Boot is a powerful framework for building Java-based applications quickly and with minimal configuration. It provides tools and plugins for rapid development.

- **React**: React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows for the creation of interactive and dynamic frontend components.

- **MySQL**: MySQL is a popular open-source relational database management system. It is used for storing and managing the application's data, such as hotel information and user bookings.

- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: JWT is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. It is used for secure authentication and authorization in the application.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Users can sign up, log in, and log out securely using JWT authentication.

- **Hotel Search**: Users can search for hotels based on location, dates, and other criteria.

- **Booking Management**: Users can view available rooms, make bookings, and manage their reservations.

- **Admin Panel**: Administrators have access to an admin panel where they can manage hotels, rooms, and bookings.

- **Responsive Design**: The application is designed to be responsive and accessible on various devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

## Architectures

The Hotel Booking App follows a client-server architecture:

- **Client-side**: The frontend of the application is built using React, which interacts with the backend API to fetch data and manage user interactions.

- **Server-side**: The backend is built using Spring Boot, which handles requests from the frontend, processes business logic, and interacts with the database.

- **Database**: MySQL is used as the database management system for storing and retrieving application data.

## Modules

The application is divided into several modules:

1. **Authentication**: Handles user authentication and authorization using JWT tokens.

2. **Hotel Management**: Manages hotel information, including details, availability, and pricing.

3. **Booking Management**: Handles user bookings, reservation details, and payment processing.

4. **Admin Panel**: Provides administrative functionalities for managing hotels, rooms, and user bookings.

## Users

The application supports multiple types of users:

1. **Guests**: Visitors who can browse hotels and view details but need to sign up or log in to make bookings.

2. **Registered Users**: Users who have signed up and logged in can make bookings, manage reservations, and access personalized features.

3. **Administrators**: Admin users have access to additional functionalities such as managing hotels, rooms, and bookings through the admin panel.

## Additional Points

- **Security**: The application prioritizes security measures such as JWT authentication, input validation, and secure communication protocols to protect user data.

- **Scalability**: The architecture is designed to be scalable, allowing for future expansion and handling a large number of users and bookings.

- **Testing**: Unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests are implemented to ensure the reliability and robustness of the application.

- **Documentation**: Detailed documentation is provided for developers, including setup instructions, API documentation, and code explanations.
